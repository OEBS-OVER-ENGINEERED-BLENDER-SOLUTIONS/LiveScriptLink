# Live Script Link

Blender addon that allows you to link internal text blocks to external files. The addon monitors the external files for changes and automatically reloads (and optionally executes) the script in Blender when the file is saved externally.

## Features
- **Multi-link management**: Link multiple files to multiple text blocks simultaneously.
- **Auto-execution**: Automatically run the script after each reload.
- **Visual Feedback**: A customizable green border indicator in the Text Editor when Live Link is active.
- **Configurable Timer**: Choose between constant polling or a delay timer.
